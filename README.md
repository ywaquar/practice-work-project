# Practice-Work-Project
This project is a part of the Internship Test Assignment for PractWorks. It includes a python program that demonstrates the ability to separate an answer into smaller steps and format it using LaTeX. Additionally, it includes the following files:

A docx file that contains comprehensive information about the internship, including the organization or company where the internship is taking place, the specific duties and responsibilities of the intern, and any necessary training or orientation.

Two python files, named "test.py" and "main.py," respectively. The "test.py" file contains unit tests designed to ensure that the code in the "main.py" file meets the specified requirements. The "main.py" file is the main code file for the assignment, containing a couple of codes necessary to complete the assignment.

A file named "output.tex," which is generated when the "main.py" file is run. This file contains the output of some computations or analyses the code performs in the "main.py" file.

## Problem Statement
The problem statement for this project is as follows:

Given inline below is a python program, save it into a file say test1.py. Make sure you can execute the program and see the output as below:

A farmer sells his product at a loss of 15%. If his S.P. was Rs 20000, what was his actual loss? What was his cost price?

The assignment is to split the lines in the "answer" text into different steps. The finished answer will have 5 steps, which are separated logically and explained better with dynamic args.

## Solution Approach
In this project, the solution approach involves using math skills and Python skills to separate the answer into five steps. The steps are stored in the Steps array, along with explanations in LaTeX format.

The five steps are as follows:

Let the cost price be x.
We have, selling price (S.P.) = Rs 20000 and loss = 15%.
Loss = 15x/100.
S.P. = C.P. - Loss.
Cost price = Rs x. Loss = Rs 3000.
Each step includes an explanation to help the user understand the solution approach better.

## Usage Instructions
To use this project, execute the test1.py file, which contains the code for the solution. Modify the code as per your requirements and test it again.

Additionally, there are two other python files, "test.py" and "main.py," that contain code designed to meet specified requirements. The "test.py" file includes unit tests for the "main.py" file. When run, the "main.py" file generates an "output.tex" file, which includes the output of computations or analyses performed in the code.

Before starting the project, refer to the docx file to understand the requirements and responsibilities of the internship.
