#Problem Statement

The problem statement for the project is as follows:

Given inline below is a python program, save it into a file say test1.py
Make sure you can execute the program and see the output as below:

A farmer sells his product at a loss of 15%. If his S.P. was Rs 20000, what was his actual loss? What was his cost price?
Assignment is to split the lines in ‘answer’ text into different steps. 
I have given you an example of the first 2 steps. It is better if you can add the steps with LaTex formatting.
You need to add an additional 3 steps containing the final answer.
You add additional steps by extending the ‘Steps’ array
Each element in the Steps array has 3 elements: step_txt, verifier, explain.
Step_txt contains the text from the answer you split into a ‘step’, and ‘explain’ both contains the text with args. Explain text will contain the text to help the user in case the user doesn’t get the answer to the step correctly.
You need to use your math skills and python skills to separate the answer into “Steps”.
In this example, the finished answer will have 5 steps. There is no fixed answer. If you split the steps logically and explain better with dynamic args better your chances of securing the internship.
Your output is the modified python program. Please reach out in case of any questions.
Solution Approach
In this project, I have demonstrated my ability to separate an answer into smaller steps and format it using LaTex. I have used my math skills and Python skills to separate the answer into five steps, which are as follows:

Let the C.P be x.
We have, S.P. = Rs %s, Loss = %s %.
Loss = %sx / %s.
S.P. = C.P. - Loss.
x = Rs%s. Loss = Rs%s - Rs%s = Rs%s.
I have used the Steps array to store these steps and their explanations in LaTex format. I have also provided explanations for each step to help the user understand the solution approach better.

#Usage Instructions
To use this project, you need to execute the test1.py file, which contains the code for the solution. You can modify the code as per your requirements and test it again.
